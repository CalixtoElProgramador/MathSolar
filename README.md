Good morning to whom it may concern.

This is an application that I developed personally. Now, it contains a user authentication section and a main section to display 
news about renewable energy and to perform photovoltaic dimensioning that the user has created. These dimensiones cannot be created now. 
However, for demonstration purposes, you can use this account to visualize the example project stored in a remote database:

aaron.calixto@outlook.com
QWEasdzxc

And this other account that does not contain any created project:

acalixtoandrade@gmail.com
QWEasdzxc

In addition, it is possible to create users in the authentication section, with the SIGN UP button. For now, it is only with email and password. 
This section is important because there is the possibility that the user can select a photo from his gallery or take it with his camera to save it 
as a profile picture. Therefore, this is where permissions are requested.

User creation, remote database and image storage space are part of the Firebase backend service.

Once logged in, you are automatically taken to the main section. Within this section, the news is displayed filtered according to the topic 
selected in the chips. All these news that appears on the screen are stored in the local database of Room. There is the possibility of marking
them to have them in a personal list and, after visualizing the news details, the article is registered as part of the search history.

When navigating to the news item details, a MotionLayout animation is automatically played.

There are several buttons, fragments and functions that are not implemented for now. They are there because I will eventually develop them as 
part of a personal project. However, it is enough to meet the requirements of the rubric. In any case, any observation or comment let me know 
and it will be corrected. In turn, your opinion as some recommendations is very welcome to continue with the development of this application.
